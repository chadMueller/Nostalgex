# Dev log

Why things changed, and what state they were left in. Newest first.
Commits carry the detail of *what*; this carries the *why*.

## 2026-10-08

**Shipped.** 1.0.23 reached the App Store (build 44). It carries the Jellyfin
channel-change fix, the Plex playback fixes, the SCREAM and TIS THE SEASON
packages, eleven new channels and the Y2K renames. The web tuner on
nostalgex.app shipped separately the same day.

**Changed.**

- Merged #5 and #7 from @Gorbataras, who found the tune-in bug independently and
  traced it further than we had, through Jellyfin's `DynamicHlsController` across
  10.10.7, 10.11.0, 10.11.11 and 12.1. #5 routes **Emby** through the same
  client-side seek Jellyfin already used, and deletes `addingStartTime`, which no
  longer had a caller. #7 stops Jellyfin and Emby direct-playing the two things
  AVPlayer will not render: HEVC in MP4 tagged `hev1` (it renders only
  `hvc1`/`dvh1`) and 10-bit H.264. Both guards already existed on the Plex path
  and had never been ported.
- Closed #3. The symptom was the tune-in bug, fixed in 1.0.23 and verified by
  @Gorbataras on an Apple TV 4K against Jellyfin 12.1.
- **Plex adaptive mode is no longer requested.** With `autoAdjustQuality=1`, any
  film where the server re-encodes both video and audio came back as 3-second
  segments: the first eight arrived at full speed, then one every 6.1 seconds for
  the rest of the film. tvOS 26 abandons a segment that slow (CoreMedia -15628)
  and the picture died at 24 seconds, at 4K and at the 1080p retry alike. With it
  off, the same request returns 1-second segments and keeps pace. Audio-copied
  streams were never affected, which is why some channels played and others did
  not.
- **Dolby Vision profile 5 plays on Plex.** Plex refuses to re-encode DV5
  (decision 2003), but it will remux it for a client it resolves as Generic,
  which is what Plex's own Apple TV app gets: `container=mp4, video=copy hevc
  DOVI 5`. On a DoVi refusal the app now re-asks once that way. Measured on
  device: picture in 1.8s, 61.6s of playhead across a 60s hold, zero stalls, zero
  dropped frames.
- **A starving stream steps down instead of freezing.** When a server cannot keep
  up, the same film is re-requested from the current position capped at 1080p,
  and only a starving capped stream advances. Previously it froze or jumped to
  the next programme.
- **An offset HLS transcode reports the remainder as its duration**, not the full
  runtime. The end-of-item fallback was adding the offset back, so `remaining`
  went negative on every tuned-in transcode and the first rate-0 moment skipped
  to the next film.
- **Web tuner: a failed stream retried forever.** The hls.js error handler
  guarded its one recovery with a flag written onto the error payload, and hls.js
  builds a fresh payload per event, so the guard never held. Measured against a
  playlist of 404s: **14,612 requests in 8 seconds**, roughly 1,800/s aimed at
  the user's own server; the same handler with the flag held outside the event
  made 14. A real session was caught making 2,239 requests for one dead segment
  while an unrelated channel played normally.
- **Web tuner: each playback now mints its own Plex transcode session** and
  releases it on the way out. Without one, Plex keyed the transcode off the
  client id alone, so every channel change quietly repurposed the previous
  session, which is what left the old loader requesting segments that 404.
- **Web tuner: a manifest that will not load now skips.** `start.m3u8` answering
  400 produces exactly one fatal `manifestLoadError` and nothing after it, so
  `startLoad()` had nothing to retry and the channel sat on black indefinitely.
  It now says so and moves to the next programme, stopping after three failures
  in a row because that points at the server rather than the file.
- **Music video genres come from Deezer** when the server reports none. On a test
  library of 1,131 music videos only 148 carried a genre, and MusicBrainz tags
  filled almost none of the rest, which is why CALIENTE and HEADBANGERS sat
  empty. Deezer resolved 47 of a random 60, and a filename cleaner (underscores,
  scene tags, `ft.`/`feat.`) recovered 10 of the 13 misses.
- **Music video years** are read from the filename first, then MusicBrainz, then
  the server only when plausible. Servers commonly report 1970 or the date the
  file was added, and Deezer's year is the album's, wrong on 15 of 15 sampled, so
  the decade channels were sorting by the wrong year.

**Half-done.**

- `fix/emby-userviews-404` — **Emby library scans fail immediately.**
  `loadSections` asked for `/UserViews?userId=`, which is Jellyfin's spelling.
  Measured against Emby Server 4.10.1.0: `/UserViews` answers 404,
  `/Users/{id}/Views` answers 200. It is the first request after sign-in, so it
  fails whatever the libraries are named and however large they are. Fixed with
  three tests on the branch, not yet merged. This is issue #6, and it is present
  in the released 1.0.23. **Now verified end to end against an Emby server**
  (see below).
- `feat/playback-failure-card` — **a programme that will not play now says why,
  instead of being swapped for the next one in silence.** Only three of about eight
  failure paths showed any UI at all; the startup watchdog, the starvation verdict and an
  AVPlayer item reaching `.failed` all advanced with nothing on screen, which reads as a
  broken app and hides whether the person should look at their server or at the file.
  `PlaybackState.error` now carries a `PlaybackFailure` rather than a sentence, and every
  failure path funnels through one place that records the verdict, emits the matching
  analytics code and shows a card for five seconds before advancing. Amber when the server
  is the thing to go and look at, red when the file or the device is.
  Getting the reason right needed a new source of truth: tvOS has no `httpStatusCode` on
  `AVPlayerItemErrorLogEvent`, so the status of a refused segment cannot be read out of the
  player, and that status is the difference between "your server refused this" and "this
  file will not decode". `StreamFailureProbe` asks the server instead, with one ranged GET
  on the URL that just failed. 14 tests, classification being a pure function over what was
  observed. Not merged.
- The startup watchdog's capped retry had the same missing client-side seek the starvation
  ladder got, so a watchdog retry on Jellyfin or Emby would have restarted the film from
  frame one. Fixed on the same branch as the ladder.
- `fix/starvation-ladder-all-backends` — **the starvation ladder had no rung on
  Jellyfin or Emby, so one stall skipped the programme.** `handleStarvation` steps
  a starving stream down to 1080p and only advances once there is nothing smaller
  to ask for, but `cappedTranscodeURL` was implemented on Plex alone and the
  `MediaBackend` default returns nil. Measured on Emby Server 4.10.1.0: each
  6-second segment took 3.4s to produce before its first byte, at 128 Mbps once
  flowing, so the server and not the network was the limit; a film jumped out
  mid-scene to the next scheduled title at its first frame. Both backends now
  build the rung at 1920 wide and 8 Mbps under their own `PlaySessionId`, with no
  start time on the URL, because the segment handler refuses one. A new
  `cappedStreamStartsAtOffset` says which backends seek client-side. 4 tests.
  Not merged.
- `fix/backend-error-copy` — error messages name the server the user actually
  connected to. `PlexAPIService.APIError` is the shared error type for all three
  backends, but every message hung off it was written for Plex, so an Emby user
  whose scan 404s was told "Plex (or your network path) returned HTTP 404" and
  sent to check Plex's Remote Access setting. Plex keeps its own copy, including
  the `/library` and `/identity` paths only Plex serves. One test asserts no
  Jellyfin or Emby message contains the word "Plex", across every error case.
  Not merged.
- `fix/guide-wrap-scrolling` — the guide's vertical wrap now runs off a focusable
  sentinel row just outside the last channel rather than a 150ms staleness timer,
  so "ran off the end" is proven by the focus engine instead of inferred from a
  clock. Up out of channel one deliberately still leaves for SETTINGS and does
  not wrap. 9 UI tests. Not merged. The report that prompted it came from tvOS
  26.6 and never reproduced on the 26.1 simulator at any list length or cadence,
  so treat this as hardening fragile timing rather than a confirmed fix.
- The web tuner still appends `StartTimeTicks` to its Jellyfin fallback URL in
  `getJellyfinTranscodeUrl` (`plex-tuner.html`). Same defect #5 fixed on tvOS.
  hls.js already seeks via `startPosition`, so the parameter only breaks segment
  requests. Spotted by @Gorbataras. In progress.
- **Emby, measured.** The Emby halves of #5 and #7 were reasoned from Jellyfin's
  HLS controller being forked from Emby's, and from Emby's own web client seeking
  client-side. Both now ran against Emby Server 4.10.1.0: sign-in, library scan,
  guide build, and a mid-programme join that started Heat at 47 minutes into a
  2:50:00 film and advanced 25s of playhead across 25s of wall clock with no
  stall. The scan only ever touches `/Users/{id}/Views` and `/Items`, and series
  and episodes go through that same `/Items` call with a different
  `IncludeItemTypes`, so a movies-only test library still exercises every HTTP
  path the scan makes. What remains untested on Emby is episode *parsing*, not
  whether an endpoint answers.

**Next.**

- Merge the three branches above.
- Port the web tuner's `StartTimeTicks` removal.
- Exercise an Emby library that contains TV series, to cover episode parsing and
  the per-show grouping the movies-only run could not reach.
